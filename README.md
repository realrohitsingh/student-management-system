## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd react-assignment
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Application

#### Option A: Start Both Frontend and Backend (Recommended)

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs both JSON Server (port 3001) and React development server (port 5173) concurrently.

#### Option B: Start Separately

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start JSON Server
npm run json-server

# Terminal 2: Start React App
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **API**: http://localhost:3001

## API Endpoints

The JSON Server provides the following REST API endpoints:

2. New classes will appear in the class filter dropdown

### Modifying Grade Scales

1. Update the `maxMarks` field in student grade objects
2. Modify the color-coding logic in components if needed

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start React development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run json-server` - Start JSON Server
- `npm start` - Start both frontend and backend

### Code Quality

- ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- React Hooks best practices
- Component-based architecture
- Service layer for API communication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to load students" Error**:

   - Ensure JSON Server is running on port 3001
   - Check if `src/database/data.json` exists and is valid JSON

2. **CORS Issues**:

   - JSON Server handles CORS automatically
   - If issues persist, check browser console for specific errors

3. **Port Conflicts**:
   - JSON Server runs on port 3001
   - React dev server runs on port 5173
   - Change ports in package.json scripts if needed

### Performance Tips

- Use the search and filter features to manage large datasets
- Reports are generated on-demand for better performance
- Consider pagination for very large student lists
